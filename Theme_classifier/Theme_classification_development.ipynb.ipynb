Darn, didn\\u2019t know there was a kid here. I\\u2019ll do it. Okay, it\\u2019s in your hands, Gantetsu. Okay. Let\\u2019s pull out! Set this place on fire! Don\\u2019t leave any evidence. The Enemy: Ninja Dropouts Wait up! Over here! You\\u2019re it. Try catching me! Darn\\u2026 \\u2013Yeah! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013This way! This way! I said wait! Lady Tsunade\\u2026 With regard to the next request\\u2026 What, there\\u2019s more? Yes. Boy oh boy\\u2026 This is the last one so please try to focus. All right. When the weather continues to be warm like this\\u2026 And what\\u2019s the request? About the escort for the convoy with the fugitive who was secured\\u2026 What about it, that\\u2019s hardly a difficult mission. Well, actually there\\u2019s a bit of a problem. Please look at this. I see. This is somewhat of a nuisance. All of the Jonin are out on S-rank missions, and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin have been allocated elsewhere. Who\\u2019s left? Let\\u2019s see\\u2026well\\u2026 Multi-Clone Jutsu! Let\\u2019s go, Bushy Brows! Here goes, Naruto! Leaf Hurricane! You jerk! Another serving of Shadow Clones for you! You ain\\u2019t seen nothing yet! You let your guard down! Pretty good, Bushy Brow\\u2026 The same to you, Naruto\\u2026 Naruto! Lee! Hey, are you guys all right? Hey, stop moving. Sakura, can\\u2019t you be a little more gentle? Shut your mouth. Really, you\\u2019re being reckless. That\\u2019s not true, Sakura. See, the 100-man Shadow Clone grapples are excellent training for enhancing one\\u2019s Taijutsu skills. It\\u2019s like killing two birds with one stone for Naruto, too because this kind of friendly training lets him polish his Shadow Clone skills at the same time. That\\u2019s exactly right. What are you talking about? All you\\u2019re doing is slugging it out. This is what ends up happening when two guys get together. That\\u2019s right. Anyway, this isn\\u2019t the time to be acting carefree like that. Lady Tsunade is calling for you. Grandma Tsunade? What does she want? Ninja Dropouts? Yeah. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNinja Dropouts are Rogue Ninja who, of their own free will, choose not to be Shinobi and leave their respective villages to join up. They\\u2019re a gang of thieves who use brutal and villainous means to steal. That\\u2019s horrible\\u2026using their abilities as Ninja for criminal purposes. That\\u2019s unforgivable. One of their members was captured yesterday in Ogi Pass in the Land of Forests. This guy is the only member whose wanted notice is circling around the lands. He was found wandering about and taken prisoner. His name is Gantetsu. For a former Ninja, that\\u2019s pretty lame. Gantesu is being taken to the capital city of the Land of Forests in order to do an exhaustive investigation into this matter for the purpose of wiping out the Ninja Dropouts\\u2026 However, there is a possibility that the Ninja Dropouts will try to rescue him along the way\\u2026 A police escort has been sent from the capital so it is fully prepared for the convoy. But since the opponents are ex-Ninja, the idea is that Shinobi would be the best countermeasure for Shinobi, so they requested that the Leaf Village also send out some Ninja. That\\u2019s what this request is all about. I\\u2019m getting excited! I\\u2019ll show \\u2018em how great Leaf Ninja are! \\u2013Got it! \\u2013Let\\u2019s give it a shot! All right! Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee. The three of you are assigned to the mission of guarding the Gantetsu convoy! \\u2013Yes, ma\\u2019am! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013Roger! Look, the harbor. Huh\\u2026 So they\\u2019re gonna transport him in this. The only way to get to the capital of the Land of Forests is to go up this river. Hey, look over there. That\\u2019s\\u2026 The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu. Are you the Leaf Ninja? Yes. Uh, and who are you? I\\u2019m Tsuzumi with the police department. I\\u2019m supervising this convoy. My name is Naruto Uzumaki. This guy here\\u2019s Bushy Brows and her name is Sakura Haruno. Hmmm\\u2026 You guys are still kids\\u2026 Are you really Ninja? We sure are. Huh, we might not look it, but we\\u2019re all full-fledged Ninja who\\u2019ve been tested by fire numerous times. We\\u2019ll display our skills for you at some point. Just leave it to us. Well, I have a strong team of experts handling security, but if it ever comes to that, I\\u2019m counting on you to use your specialty, Ninjutsu. Got it. Those are the security personnel guarding the prisoner. They\\u2019re all dressed alike, aren\\u2019t they? Huh, they don\\u2019t have much style. Naruto, that\\u2019s rude. Captain Todoroki! What is it, Commander Tsuzumi? These people came from the Village Hidden in the Leaves as reinforcements. The name\\u2019s Naruto Uzumaki. I\\u2019m Sakura Haruno. My name is Rock Lee. Commander, I told you already. We already have enough security on this. Can\\u2019t be helped. lt\\u2019s something the bosses decided. There won\\u2019t be any role for you guys to play. We will guard Gantetsu. I promise that on this sword. Huh\\u2026 That sword\\u2019s nothing. Snapping that thing in half would be as easy as apple pie. Yeah, with just one finger. Stop it, you guys! Please excuse them\\u2026 Be careful not to get seasick. Well, I leave it to you. Y-Yes, sir. Thanks. Gantetsu\\u2026 All right\\u2026 Put the cage into the belly of the ship! Okay\\u2026Okay\\u2026 Okay, lower it! Wow\\u2026 This feels great! What the heck is this anyway? They won\\u2019t let us even get near him. They\\u2019re totally treating us like nuisances. If only those Ninja Dropout guys would launch an attack, we could show them how awesome we are. Don\\u2019t say stupid things like that. The best scenario would be that the Ninja Dropout won\\u2019t show up at all. Our mission is to transport Gantetsu safely to the capital, you know. But this is getting too boring\\u2026 there\\u2019s no thrill to it. Better just grin and bear it. There are missions like this too. Well, I sure understand how you feel, Naruto. Yeah\\u2026 I guess this is getting a little boring. Dig in\\u2026 Gimme a break\\u2026 Who do those guys think we are? But this stuff is pretty good. Yeah, very tasty. It makes me so mad\\u2026 I mean, why did we go to all the trouble of coming all this way? I\\u2019m gonna do my mission. Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu. But the captain\\u2019s gonna scold you. I\\u2019m doing this out of Ninja pride! Uh, Naruto! Naruto! He does have the face of a criminal after all. Todoroki? What the heck is he doing here? Akio\\u2026! Damn! Father! Mother! Akio\\u2026 Akio! Damn! Akio\\u2026! I will avenge your death right now! Oh! What the heck are you doing?! Are you in your right mind? What was it you were about to do just now?! Ninja Art: Crimson Mud. Oh? What\\u2019s the matter, Sakura? Lee, over there. That\\u2019s strange\\u2026 I\\u2019ve never knew this river has a tributary. Why are you in here? Why does that matter? What were you about to do to Gantetsu!? What are you talking about? It looked to me like you were going to kill him. Huh? Me? That\\u2019s a stupid thing to say. It\\u2019s my mission to guard this guy. Why would I?! Yeah, I guess. Even if he is a criminal, you can\\u2019t just kill him off without interrogating him first. A brat talking like he knows, huh? There isn\\u2019t any need to interrogate him! This is the guy who did it! Huh? This guy\\u2026 These guys\\u2026slaughtered a lot of people without mercy\\u2026 Even innocent children. If things continue like this, we\\u2019ll be sucked into the tributary\\u2026 What should we do?! Ninja Art: Link and Slay. What the heck?! Wh-What is this? Th-The ship\\u2019s been sliced in half\\u2026 Naruto! Naruto! You jerk! It\\u2019s them! The Ninja Dropouts! So they showed up after all\\u2026 Gantetsu\\u2026 Reinforcements, huh?! Hey, who are you guys anyway! The head of the Ninja Dropouts, Shura, on the scene! Ninja Dropouts\\u2026 We\\u2019ll take Gantetsu\\u2026 I\\u2019m not about to let that happen! The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it Because I want to find the joy without a shape This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words, I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of what we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away Even if I\\u2019m told that there is no bright future I\\u2019ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for the answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door Will always be smiling right near by Lee, are you all right? Yes, somehow. More importantly, what happened? I don\\u2019t know. Only thing I know is that after that huge crash, suddenly the ship was sliced in two\\u2026 I see. Well then, we need to confirm everyone\\u2019s safety for the moment\\u2026 Well\\u2026 What\\u2019s wrong, Sakura? I can\\u2019t find the prisoner, Gantetsu, Captain Todoroki, and Naruto.

Always the bothersome guy with the man and woman stuff! Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after the guys who took our village girl. Forget about here and head for them! We\\u2019ve received information. Gaara and Kankuro have entered their respective battles. I see\\u2026 The shadow won\\u2019t reach, I guess\\u2026 Leaf Village\\u2019s two-man cells are just now heading there for back-up. How well prepared. It\\u2019s a pain, but as long as we\\u2019re doing this, we\\u2019ll do it right. We\\u2019ll do it perfectly without producing casualties! Make sure you don\\u2019t cry in front of me this time. Are you going to hold that over my head forever? Just like a woman\\u2026 I-I feel like I don\\u2019t really have my place in this.

To think you\\u2019d ask the Leaf Village for help\\u2026 I guess the Sand has lost the edge they used to have, huh? Why are you here? You know, dogs. They\\u2019re not satisfied until a favor has been properly returned. Especially this Akamaru! A dog retuning a favor doesn\\u2019t have much of a ring to it! Help is on the way to the other two as well. You concentrate on this fight! You\\u2019re giving me lip! So you flies are gonna gang up on me, huh? But you\\u2019re no match for my Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword. Eat this! If your Chakra isn't built up, your sand is no big deal at all! It\\u2019ll only be useful for blinding me at best! It\\u2019s futile! I feel it. Your Chakra is being sucked up. What?! He was setting the sand in the gourd aside?! I was being cautious, but he is much too strong. Gaara Sensei! Just what I\\u2019d expect from Gaara of the Sand. He\\u2019s not called the ultimate weapon for nothing\\u2026 The ultimate\\u2026weapon?! However, he cannot exceed our Ninja tools forged in the Village of the Artisans! Gaara! Hey, he\\u2019s totally got the edge! Do we have a chance to return the favor? That\\u2019s incredible wind. What an amount of Chakra\\u2026 No, it seems that sword is amplifying her Chakra. So she\\u2019s relying on that sword for all of her attack and defense, huh? Anyway, we\\u2019ve got to slip within firing range for our Jutsu and stop her movements! Right. Let\\u2019s go at once! Annoying! She\\u2019s attempting to maintain her distance just from Temari. I see. So she just wants to pay attention to the long range-type Temari and blow us mid-range Jutsu users away with wind before we can get close, huh\\u2026? Now then, what should we do? Man Beast Clone! Partial Expansion Jutsu! Crow! \\u2013 Arms! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Fang Over Fang! Did you guys come to get in my way?! We made sure to send you a signal, right?! How could I tell?!

Although I reduced the damage with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still\\u2026 Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara, the Sand\\u2019s ultimate weapon who hosts the Shukaku\\u2026 But you\\u2019re already in our hands. What should I do? She\\u2019s beyond the range of my Jutsu\\u2026 and I don\\u2019t see anything around here that could be used to extend my shadow. Hey! What\\u2019re you whispering about? What\\u2019re you thinking?! I\\u2019ll explain later, for crying out loud. Can you do it or not? I suppose I could try, but\\u2026 What is it\\u2026? What\\u2019s he doing? Behold the terror of Ninja tools our village created. What\\u2019s this Chakra? This is a water vein! I get it! The lines connecting the point in the center and triangle isn\\u2019t a Barrier\\u2026 It\\u2019s a water vein! Ninja Tool Barrier: Reverse Scale Formation\\u2026 Activate! Oh no! Gaara Sensei! The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation was a single point, Gaara from the start! Our swords accurately pierce a water vein and summon the water dragon. Sand has sucked up a large amount of water and has become as heavy as lead\\u2026 Now Gaara can no longer use sand. Gaara! \\u2013 Gaara! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Calm down! Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara! That guy is?! They\\u2019ll save Gaara, no matter what. We need to concentrate on the enemy in front of us. To think you\\u2019d choose a sandy area to fall on\\u2026 Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara of the desert\\u2026 However! That\\u2019s as far as your useless resistance goes! Leaf Hurricane! A hero\\u2019s turn always comes late! That\\u2019s right! Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara! Naruto\\u2026! It seems you rushed to everyone during the Sasuke incident\\u2026 This time we\\u2019ve come to return the favor from that time. So we\\u2019ll take that guy on! You hurry to your student straight on! To think he\\u2019d corner you this far\\u2026 \\u2013 Lee! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Sakura! Leave Gaara\\u2019s treatment to me! Lee, you go with Naruto! \\u2013 Sakura! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Got it! Then I\\u2019ll be going first! Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra! I\\u2019ll suck up all of your Chakra! I see. So this means we can\\u2019t release our regular power? That doesn\\u2019t matter! Even without Chakra, we\\u2019ve got fighting spirit! Yes! We\\u2019ll go with that plus willpower! Just as I thought. That they haven\\u2019t launched anything during the fight thus far means the two reinforcements don\\u2019t have long range-type Jutsu. Then I\\u2019ll maintain this distance and\\u2026 you\\u2019ll die getting torn up by the wind! While she\\u2019s distracted by Shikamaru and the others, I\\u2019ll just go for it! Mind Destruction\\u2026! Ino! Foolish girl. It\\u2019s useless to attempt to exploit an opening! You little! You won\\u2019t get close to me! I\\u2019ve read your range as well!

Partial Expansion Jutsu! Oh\\u2026! What\\u2019re you doing?! Are you guys\\u2026mocking me? After sucking up all of your Chakra, I\\u2019ll be returning the favor plenty! The contusion treatment is complete. But, the depletion of Chakra is overwhelming. Contact from your friends\\u2026? \\u2013 Ino\\u2019s hurt?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Go! Wha--?! But in your condition\\u2026 I\\u2019m okay now. Help your friend! Okay. Don\\u2019t push yourself. Yeah\\u2026 What\\u2019re you doing?! Hurry up and go after your comrade! I\\u2019ll help my comrade. I\\u2019ll settle this in a moment. But\\u2026 Bushy Brow! Damn it. It\\u2019s no good just shot-gunning it! It\\u2019s just him?

The counterattack starts now! It\\u2019s futile. Your Jutsu won\\u2019t reach me! You never know until you try, right\\u2026?! Here we go! Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe! Huh?! What\\u2019re you aiming at?! Totally misguided\\u2026 Say what? What\\u2019s the meaning of this? I\\u2019m sure I\\u2019d read your range already\\u2026! I\\u2019ll show you! I can create a shadow with this thick a current even if the water\\u2019s clear. My Jutsu\\u2019s range has infinitely improved by lifting the waterfall! The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!

I\\u2019m incapable of doing anything\\u2026 There\\u2019s nothing I\\u2019m capable of doing\\u2026 The person I am now isn\\u2019t\\u2026 capable of doing anything! Arashi! Sasame\\u2026 You! Sasame! Please\\u2026come to your senses\\u2026 Become the old Arashi again! I told you, already! The old Arashi is dead. Arashi\\u2026 I\\u2019m sorry, Sasame\\u2026 I wanted power\\u2026 I wanted the Fuma Clan to find a place in the sun once again\\u2026 Yes! I understand that! I understand that! But, enough now\\u2026 Let\\u2019s go home. Let\\u2019s go back to the village. But, I\\u2019m just a mere monster now\\u2026 That\\u2019s not true! This is agony\\u2026 Sassme\\u2026 Please\\u2026 kill me\\u2026 Please\\u2026kill\\u2026 How dare you try to kill me! Arashi! You\\u2019ll\\u2026die! Sakura! Sakura?! You wanna be\\u2026 the first to die? Sasame taught me that\\u2026 dying isn\\u2019t anything to be scared of! I see\\u2026 But what\\u2019s scary is to live one\\u2019s life without having been able to do anything\\u2026 I\\u2019m not afraid to die in the service of someone who is important to me! Don\\u2019t! I\\u2019m telling you\\u2026 Whatever happens, you mustn\\u2019t die\\u2026 No matter what! Sakura! Naruto! Give it up! What is it you think you\\u2019re capable of doing the way you are now?! That\\u2019s so useless! Vanish from this world get crushed into nothing\\u2026! Sasame! Stop that, Arashi! Sasame\\u2026you! Naruto! Hey! Let go! No! Arashi?! I\\u2019m sorry, Sasame\\u2026 I caused you so much hardship\\u2026 No, you haven\\u2019t! The person who experienced the greatest hardship is you, Arashi! Is there anything I can do for you? What should I do for you?! You\\u2019ve already helped me more than enough\\u2026 See\\u2026 Thanks to you, Sasame, I was able to return to being the person I was in the past\\u2026 Naruto! Sakura\\u2026 Even if it\\u2019s to be of service to someone\\u2026 There\\u2019s no life that should be lost for that! Yeah! Run! Sakura! Pervy Sage! Sorry to be late! I was faced with a number of obstacles on my end too! Gimme a break\\u2026 Now then\\u2026 Climb on, climb on! Hurry! Let\\u2019s get back above ground! Oops! Sasame! She\\u2019s fine\\u2026 She just fainted. Naruto! Orochimaru assigned us a mission\\u2026 To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back to the Village Hidden in the Leaves under any circumstances! Then, Sasuke is\\u2026?! Yeah\\u2026 He\\u2019s alive! Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke because he is his vital vessel which he will possess in three years! Arashi\\u2026 Arashi\\u2026 This place is gonna collapse! Hurry up and come over here! I\\u2019m already just a puppet\\u2026 I cannot live my life anywhere except here. Arashi\\u2026 All right! No! Arashi! Sasame\\u2026 Thank you. Including Arashi, we\\u2019ve paid an extraordinary price but\\u2026 The Fuma Clan has been able to cut itself free from Orochimaru\\u2019s spell\\u2026 You can start again anew. I will rebuild the Clan again without fail! With this life\\u2026 that Arashi protected. Yeah! I am truly indebted to you. Sasame\\u2026 Hanzaki, I\\u2019m leaving these two in your hands! Yes, sir! Please take care along the road! I will. \\u2013 Thank you! \\u2013 We thank you! \\u2013 Take care! \\u2013 See you again! Hey! Hang in there! Well, we weren\\u2019t able to find Sasuke, but at least we now know that he\\u2019s alive somewhere\\u2026 We\\u2019ll have to settle for the fact that we were able to ascertain the new information that we still have a grace period of three years before he becomes a vessel to be possessed by Orochimaru. Yes\\u2026 Sasame knew what she needed to do for her clan\\u2026 But this time again all I did was cry. All I did was depend on Naruto\\u2026 Sakura! You gave your best effort too! No, I was just a ball and chain to everyone\\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t capable of doing anything alone\\u2026 That\\u2019s not true! Seeing you give your best effort like that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura. If you hadn\\u2019t been there, Sakura, I\\u2019d have been crushed just like that. It\\u2019s thanks to you, Sakura! Naruto\\u2026 Wow, you\\u2019ve grown into someone who can say that sort of thing! Oww! I\\u2019m an injured man! Treat me with a little more care! Oh yeah, that\\u2019s right! All I was thinking about at that time was protecting someone I cared about\\u2026 What I\\u2019m capable of doing right now\\u2026 I was thinking\\u2026 What? There are many variables such as mission level, or platoon\\u2019s member structure\\u2026 But no matter how small a platoon might be, I think it\\u2019s important to assign one Medical Ninja to it\\u2026 I know that already\\u2026 I wrote exactly the same thing in a report long ago regarding the survival rate and mission achievement rate of small platoons. But it\\u2019s not that easy to nurture Medical Ninja. They require a different set of skills than that of fighting types Ninja\\u2026 The minute perfection of Chakra control, the ability to assimilate a huge volume of specialized knowledge, the brains to apply that in a broad way\\u2026 patience\\u2026 And there is the most important thing for Shinobi who are to develop into a Medical Ninja\\u2026 Well, I\\u2019m busy right now, so\\u2026 The most important thing\\u2026huh? Hidden Leaf Hospital \\t\\t I\\u2019m all wrapped up in bandages again\\u2026 This way I can\\u2019t even hold chopsticks\\u2026 Sakura, when it\\u2019s time for my meal, feed me, okay? I\\u2019ll open up my mouth just like this and\\u2026 Huh? Sakura? I\\u2019m sorry! I was just joking! I\\u2019m sorry\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026 Huh? This is gonna mean that I\\u2019ll keep you waiting a little but\\u2026 Next time, I definitely won\\u2019t\\u2026 be a ball-and-chain to you! Huh? Enter! I came here with a request! What is it? Please make me your apprentice! You\\u2019re very desperate, aren\\u2019t you? Sakura Haruno, I heard from Kakashi that you have a brilliant mind as well as will power! All right. But in exchange, I\\u2019m not gonna be easy on you! Yes, ma\\u2019am! This recent mission\\u2026 looks like it wasn\\u2019t wasted on her, after all. When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though I had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands A droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words I\\u2019ll keep these thoughts\\u2026 He makes me so angry, that Pervy Sage! Didn\\u2019t he say \\u201cI\\u2019ll make you my disciple and hone your skills\\u201d?! When Sakura\\u2019s already become the Old Lady Tsunade's and is working so hard! And he just leaves me to my own devices! Hey! All because he was assigned a mission by Old Lady Tsunade! If things come to this, I\\u2019m gonna give the Old Lady Tsunade a piece of my mind!

Darn, didn\\u2019t know there was a kid here. I\\u2019ll do it. Okay, it\\u2019s in your hands, Gantetsu. Okay. Let\\u2019s pull out! Set this place on fire! Don\\u2019t leave any evidence. The Enemy: Ninja Dropouts Wait up! Over here! You\\u2019re it. Try catching me! Darn\\u2026 \\u2013Yeah! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013This way! This way! I said wait! Lady Tsunade\\u2026 With regard to the next request\\u2026 What, there\\u2019s more? Yes. Boy oh boy\\u2026 This is the last one so please try to focus. All right. When the weather continues to be warm like this\\u2026 And what\\u2019s the request? About the escort for the convoy with the fugitive who was secured\\u2026 What about it, that\\u2019s hardly a difficult mission. Well, actually there\\u2019s a bit of a problem. Please look at this. I see. This is somewhat of a nuisance. All of the Jonin are out on S-rank missions, and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin have been allocated elsewhere. Who\\u2019s left? Let\\u2019s see\\u2026well\\u2026 Multi-Clone Jutsu! Let\\u2019s go, Bushy Brows! Here goes, Naruto! Leaf Hurricane! You jerk! Another serving of Shadow Clones for you! You ain\\u2019t seen nothing yet! You let your guard down! Pretty good, Bushy Brow\\u2026 The same to you, Naruto\\u2026 Naruto! Lee! Hey, are you guys all right? Hey, stop moving. Sakura, can\\u2019t you be a little more gentle? Shut your mouth. Really, you\\u2019re being reckless. That\\u2019s not true, Sakura. See, the 100-man Shadow Clone grapples are excellent training for enhancing one\\u2019s Taijutsu skills. It\\u2019s like killing two birds with one stone for Naruto, too because this kind of friendly training lets him polish his Shadow Clone skills at the same time. That\\u2019s exactly right. What are you talking about? All you\\u2019re doing is slugging it out. This is what ends up happening when two guys get together. That\\u2019s right. Anyway, this isn\\u2019t the time to be acting carefree like that. Lady Tsunade is calling for you. Grandma Tsunade? What does she want? Ninja Dropouts? Yeah. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNinja Dropouts are Rogue Ninja who, of their own free will, choose not to be Shinobi and leave their respective villages to join up. They\\u2019re a gang of thieves who use brutal and villainous means to steal. That\\u2019s horrible\\u2026using their abilities as Ninja for criminal purposes. That\\u2019s unforgivable. One of their members was captured yesterday in Ogi Pass in the Land of Forests. This guy is the only member whose wanted notice is circling around the lands. He was found wandering about and taken prisoner. His name is Gantetsu. For a former Ninja, that\\u2019s pretty lame. Gantesu is being taken to the capital city of the Land of Forests in order to do an exhaustive investigation into this matter for the purpose of wiping out the Ninja Dropouts\\u2026 However, there is a possibility that the Ninja Dropouts will try to rescue him along the way\\u2026 A police escort has been sent from the capital so it is fully prepared for the convoy. But since the opponents are ex-Ninja, the idea is that Shinobi would be the best countermeasure for Shinobi, so they requested that the Leaf Village also send out some Ninja. That\\u2019s what this request is all about. I\\u2019m getting excited! I\\u2019ll show \\u2018em how great Leaf Ninja are! \\u2013Got it! \\u2013Let\\u2019s give it a shot! All right! Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee. The three of you are assigned to the mission of guarding the Gantetsu convoy! \\u2013Yes, ma\\u2019am! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013Roger! Look, the harbor. Huh\\u2026 So they\\u2019re gonna transport him in this. The only way to get to the capital of the Land of Forests is to go up this river. Hey, look over there. That\\u2019s\\u2026 The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu. Are you the Leaf Ninja? Yes. Uh, and who are you? I\\u2019m Tsuzumi with the police department. I\\u2019m supervising this convoy. My name is Naruto Uzumaki. This guy here\\u2019s Bushy Brows and her name is Sakura Haruno. Hmmm\\u2026 You guys are still kids\\u2026 Are you really Ninja? We sure are. Huh, we might not look it, but we\\u2019re all full-fledged Ninja who\\u2019ve been tested by fire numerous times. We\\u2019ll display our skills for you at some point. Just leave it to us. Well, I have a strong team of experts handling security, but if it ever comes to that, I\\u2019m counting on you to use your specialty, Ninjutsu. Got it. Those are the security personnel guarding the prisoner. They\\u2019re all dressed alike, aren\\u2019t they? Huh, they don\\u2019t have much style. Naruto, that\\u2019s rude. Captain Todoroki! What is it, Commander Tsuzumi? These people came from the Village Hidden in the Leaves as reinforcements. The name\\u2019s Naruto Uzumaki. I\\u2019m Sakura Haruno. My name is Rock Lee. Commander, I told you already. We already have enough security on this. Can\\u2019t be helped. lt\\u2019s something the bosses decided. There won\\u2019t be any role for you guys to play. We will guard Gantetsu. I promise that on this sword. Huh\\u2026 That sword\\u2019s nothing. Snapping that thing in half would be as easy as apple pie. Yeah, with just one finger. Stop it, you guys! Please excuse them\\u2026 Be careful not to get seasick. Well, I leave it to you. Y-Yes, sir. Thanks. Gantetsu\\u2026 All right\\u2026 Put the cage into the belly of the ship! Okay\\u2026Okay\\u2026 Okay, lower it! Wow\\u2026 This feels great! What the heck is this anyway? They won\\u2019t let us even get near him. They\\u2019re totally treating us like nuisances. If only those Ninja Dropout guys would launch an attack, we could show them how awesome we are. Don\\u2019t say stupid things like that. The best scenario would be that the Ninja Dropout won\\u2019t show up at all. Our mission is to transport Gantetsu safely to the capital, you know. But this is getting too boring\\u2026 there\\u2019s no thrill to it. Better just grin and bear it. There are missions like this too. Well, I sure understand how you feel, Naruto. Yeah\\u2026 I guess this is getting a little boring. Dig in\\u2026 Gimme a break\\u2026 Who do those guys think we are? But this stuff is pretty good. Yeah, very tasty. It makes me so mad\\u2026 I mean, why did we go to all the trouble of coming all this way? I\\u2019m gonna do my mission. Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu. But the captain\\u2019s gonna scold you. I\\u2019m doing this out of Ninja pride! Uh, Naruto! Naruto! He does have the face of a criminal after all. Todoroki? What the heck is he doing here? Akio\\u2026! Damn! Father! Mother! Akio\\u2026 Akio! Damn! Akio\\u2026! I will avenge your death right now! Oh! What the heck are you doing?! Are you in your right mind? What was it you were about to do just now?! Ninja Art: Crimson Mud. Oh? What\\u2019s the matter, Sakura? Lee, over there. That\\u2019s strange\\u2026 I\\u2019ve never knew this river has a tributary. Why are you in here? Why does that matter? What were you about to do to Gantetsu!? What are you talking about? It looked to me like you were going to kill him. Huh? Me? That\\u2019s a stupid thing to say. It\\u2019s my mission to guard this guy. Why would I?! Yeah, I guess. Even if he is a criminal, you can\\u2019t just kill him off without interrogating him first. A brat talking like he knows, huh? There isn\\u2019t any need to interrogate him! This is the guy who did it! Huh? This guy\\u2026 These guys\\u2026slaughtered a lot of people without mercy\\u2026 Even innocent children. If things continue like this, we\\u2019ll be sucked into the tributary\\u2026 What should we do?! Ninja Art: Link and Slay. What the heck?! Wh-What is this? Th-The ship\\u2019s been sliced in half\\u2026 Naruto! Naruto! You jerk! It\\u2019s them! The Ninja Dropouts! So they showed up after all\\u2026 Gantetsu\\u2026 Reinforcements, huh?! Hey, who are you guys anyway! The head of the Ninja Dropouts, Shura, on the scene! Ninja Dropouts\\u2026 We\\u2019ll take Gantetsu\\u2026 I\\u2019m not about to let that happen! The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it Because I want to find the joy without a shape This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words, I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of what we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away Even if I\\u2019m told that there is no bright future I\\u2019ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for the answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door Will always be smiling right near by Lee, are you all right? Yes, somehow. More importantly, what happened? I don\\u2019t know. Only thing I know is that after that huge crash, suddenly the ship was sliced in two\\u2026 I see. Well then, we need to confirm everyone\\u2019s safety for the moment\\u2026 Well\\u2026 What\\u2019s wrong, Sakura? I can\\u2019t find the prisoner, Gantetsu, Captain Todoroki, and Naruto.

Gaara and Kankuro have entered their respective battles. I see\\u2026 The shadow won\\u2019t reach, I guess\\u2026 Leaf Village\\u2019s two-man cells are just now heading there for back-up.

To think you\\u2019d ask the Leaf Village for help\\u2026 I guess the Sand has lost the edge they used to have, huh? Why are you here? You know, dogs. They\\u2019re not satisfied until a favor has been properly returned. Especially this Akamaru! A dog retuning a favor doesn\\u2019t have much of a ring to it! Help is on the way to the other two as well. You concentrate on this fight! You\\u2019re giving me lip! So you flies are gonna gang up on me, huh? But you\\u2019re no match for my Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword. Eat this! If your Chakra isn't built up, your sand is no big deal at all! It\\u2019ll only be useful for blinding me at best! It\\u2019s futile! I feel it. Your Chakra is being sucked up. What?! He was setting the sand in the gourd aside?! I was being cautious, but he is much too strong. Gaara Sensei! Just what I\\u2019d expect from Gaara of the Sand. He\\u2019s not called the ultimate weapon for nothing\\u2026 The ultimate\\u2026weapon?! However, he cannot exceed our Ninja tools forged in the Village of the Artisans! Gaara! Hey, he\\u2019s totally got the edge! Do we have a chance to return the favor? That\\u2019s incredible wind. What an amount of Chakra\\u2026 No, it seems that sword is amplifying her Chakra. So she\\u2019s relying on that sword for all of her attack and defense, huh? Anyway, we\\u2019ve got to slip within firing range for our Jutsu and stop her movements! Right. Let\\u2019s go at once! Annoying! She\\u2019s attempting to maintain her distance just from Temari. I see. So she just wants to pay attention to the long range-type Temari and blow us mid-range Jutsu users away with wind before we can get close, huh\\u2026? Now then, what should we do?

Although I reduced the damage with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still\\u2026 Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara, the Sand\\u2019s ultimate weapon who hosts the Shukaku\\u2026 But you\\u2019re already in our hands. What should I do? She\\u2019s beyond the range of my Jutsu\\u2026 and I don\\u2019t see anything around here that could be used to extend my shadow. Hey! What\\u2019re you whispering about? What\\u2019re you thinking?! I\\u2019ll explain later, for crying out loud. Can you do it or not? I suppose I could try, but\\u2026 What is it\\u2026? What\\u2019s he doing? Behold the terror of Ninja tools our village created. What\\u2019s this Chakra? This is a water vein! I get it! The lines connecting the point in the center and triangle isn\\u2019t a Barrier\\u2026 It\\u2019s a water vein! Ninja Tool Barrier: Reverse Scale Formation\\u2026 Activate! Oh no! Gaara Sensei! The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation was a single point, Gaara from the start! Our swords accurately pierce a water vein and summon the water dragon. Sand has sucked up a large amount of water and has become as heavy as lead\\u2026 Now Gaara can no longer use sand. Gaara! \\u2013 Gaara! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Calm down! Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara! That guy is?! They\\u2019ll save Gaara, no matter what. We need to concentrate on the enemy in front of us. To think you\\u2019d choose a sandy area to fall on\\u2026 Just what I\\u2019d expect of Gaara of the desert\\u2026 However! That\\u2019s as far as your useless resistance goes! Leaf Hurricane! A hero\\u2019s turn always comes late! That\\u2019s right! Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara! Naruto\\u2026! It seems you rushed to everyone during the Sasuke incident\\u2026 This time we\\u2019ve come to return the favor from that time. So we\\u2019ll take that guy on! You hurry to your student straight on! To think he\\u2019d corner you this far\\u2026 \\u2013 Lee! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Sakura! Leave Gaara\\u2019s treatment to me! Lee, you go with Naruto! \\u2013 Sakura! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Got it! Then I\\u2019ll be going first! Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra! I\\u2019ll suck up all of your Chakra! I see. So this means we can\\u2019t release our regular power? That doesn\\u2019t matter! Even without Chakra, we\\u2019ve got fighting spirit! Yes! We\\u2019ll go with that plus willpower! Just as I thought. That they haven\\u2019t launched anything during the fight thus far means the two reinforcements don\\u2019t have long range-type Jutsu. Then I\\u2019ll maintain this distance and\\u2026 you\\u2019ll die getting torn up by the wind! While she\\u2019s distracted by Shikamaru and the others, I\\u2019ll just go for it! Mind Destruction\\u2026! Ino! Foolish girl. It\\u2019s useless to attempt to exploit an opening! You little! You won\\u2019t get close to me! I\\u2019ve read your range as well! I don\\u2019t know about that\\u2026! Ino! You stay right there! I\\u2019m counting on you\\u2026! Shino! Sakura! There\\u2019s one wounded at the waterfall. Tunneling Fang! Now! Partial Expansion Jutsu! Oh\\u2026! What\\u2019re you doing?! Are you guys\\u2026mocking me? After sucking up all of your Chakra, I\\u2019ll be returning the favor plenty! The contusion treatment is complete. But, the depletion of Chakra is overwhelming. Contact from your friends\\u2026? \\u2013 Ino\\u2019s hurt?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Go! Wha--?! But in your condition\\u2026 I\\u2019m okay now. Help your friend! Okay. Don\\u2019t push yourself. Yeah\\u2026 What\\u2019re you doing?! Hurry up and go after your comrade! I\\u2019ll help my comrade. I\\u2019ll settle this in a moment. But\\u2026 Bushy Brow! Damn it. It\\u2019s no good just shot-gunning it! It\\u2019s just him? A part of Black Ant\\u2026 Could it be\\u2026a signal? Fang Over Fang once more! Back me up with Crow! I\\u2019m counting on you for back up too, Choji! Got it! Heh! Bossing me around. The counterattack starts now! It\\u2019s futile. Your Jutsu won\\u2019t reach me! You never know until you try, right\\u2026?! Here we go! Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe! Huh?! What\\u2019re you aiming at?! Totally misguided\\u2026 Say what? What\\u2019s the meaning of this? I\\u2019m sure I\\u2019d read your range already\\u2026! I\\u2019ll show you! I can create a shadow with this thick a current even if the water\\u2019s clear. My Jutsu\\u2019s range has infinitely improved by lifting the waterfall! The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success! Summoning\\u2026 Blade Dance! This one\\u2019s done! Good grief\\u2026 I\\u2026couldn\\u2019t do anything. Here everyone\\u2019s doing their best\\u2026 Only I\\u2026 Ino? Gaara. You don\\u2019t have any sand left you can use. What\\u2019s this?! He smashed the Sand Armor. No way! But the sand heavy with water like that\\u2026 If I just suck up the Chakra\\u2026 This is my weapon! You okay, Gaara?! This is the finishing blow\\u2026 Gaara Sensei! Hurry! Leave the rest to us! Man Beast Clone! Fang Over Fang! Partial Expansion Jutsu! Annoying buzzing flies! Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword! What?! Oh, no! Puppet Show\\u2026 Secret Black Move Iron Maiden! The show\\u2019s  over! \\u2013 We did it! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Yeah! Matsuri. Gaara and\\u2026! A Shinobi carrying a child on his back. He\\u2019s heading for the valley. The last one\\u2026 Gaara is chasing him! What?! You okay, Bushy Brow? Sakura will be right back. Thanks. Well, I\\u2019m going after Gaara! Got it! I\\u2019ll meet up with you later! I\\u2019ve got him cornered. Matsuri. The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it Because I want to find the joy without a shape This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words, I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of what we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away Even if I\\u2019m told that there is no bright future I\\u2019ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for the answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart\\u2019s door Will always be smiling right near by I heard you figured out the identities of the Four Celestials? Yes. They are the Ninja of the Village of the Artisans who've been harboring ill feeling toward the Five Great Nations. It seems they\\u2019ve completed the forbidden project passed down in the village and intend to resurrect their ultimate weapon. I see. I take it the other villagers got wind of it and evacuated. Exactly. You head over to where they are immediately. Yes, ma\\u2019am. Next time: \\u201cThe Ultimate Weapon Reborn\\u201d\",\n          \"Hey boys, listen up!

Where did you put him?! Heh! You\\u2019re Naruto, right? You wouldn\\u2019t believe anything I said anyway, would you\\u2026? That\\u2019s right! I won\\u2019t believe that Sasuke\\u2019s dead! Naruto\\u2026 That\\u2019s right. Sasuke is alive. I\\u2019ll bring Sasuke back! I made that promise! Naruto\\u2026 In that case, take me down! If I were the wimp I was in the past, I would probably have told you the truth. Arashi! No! The old Arashi is dead! The person you see here is just a block of flesh kept alive by Ninja Art: Cadaver Puppets! Sakura, please look after Sasame! Stop it, Naruto! Don\\u2019t fight with Arashi! No! This guy isn\\u2019t the same gentle Arashi you once knew, Sasame! Jigumo! Go! No! Sasame! I'm sorry! Over here! Naruto! Don\\u2019t, Sakura! Kamikiri\\u2026! Finish him! Naruto! You\\u2019re\\u2026next\\u2026! Sakura! That was close\\u2026 I almost let my guard down. Just when you had a chance to launch a sneak attack. You blew it, didn\\u2019t you, Naruto? Naruto! All because of that ball and chain\\u2026! Ball and chain\\u2026?! Naruto\\u2026 I'm sorry! That\\u2019s not true at all! This kind of injury\\u2026 is nothing\\u2026at all! Shadow Clone Jutsu!

This is the end! What?! Naruto! The Chakra cage gradually shrinks\\u2026 And the human enclosed therein is crushed to the size of a tiny nugget. You can\\u2019t break it. As long as I myself do not dissolve the Jutsu. Naruto! I\\u2019m incapable of doing anything\\u2026 There\\u2019s nothing I\\u2019m capable of doing\\u2026 The person I am now isn\\u2019t\\u2026 capable of doing anything! Arashi! Sasame\\u2026 You! Sasame! Please\\u2026come to your senses\\u2026 Become the old Arashi again! I told you, already! The old Arashi is dead. Arashi\\u2026 I\\u2019m sorry, Sasame\\u2026 I wanted power\\u2026 I wanted the Fuma Clan to find a place in the sun once again\\u2026 Yes! I understand that! I understand that! But, enough now\\u2026 Let\\u2019s go home. Let\\u2019s go back to the village. But, I\\u2019m just a mere monster now\\u2026 That\\u2019s not true!

You wanna be\\u2026 the first to die? Sasame taught me that\\u2026 dying isn\\u2019t anything to be scared of! I see\\u2026 But what\\u2019s scary is to live one\\u2019s life without having been able to do anything\\u2026 I\\u2019m not afraid to die in the service of someone who is important to me! Don\\u2019t! I\\u2019m telling you\\u2026 Whatever happens, you mustn\\u2019t die\\u2026 No matter what! Sakura! Naruto! Give it up! What is it you think you\\u2019re capable of doing the way you are now?! That\\u2019s so useless! Vanish from this world get crushed into nothing\\u2026! Sasame! Stop that, Arashi! Sasame\\u2026you! Naruto! Hey! Let go! No! Arashi?! I\\u2019m sorry, Sasame\\u2026 I caused you so much hardship\\u2026 No, you haven\\u2019t! The person who experienced the greatest hardship is you, Arashi! Is there anything I can do for you? What should I do for you?! You\\u2019ve already helped me more than enough\\u2026 See\\u2026 Thanks to you, Sasame, I was able to return to being the person I was in the past\\u2026 Naruto! Sakura\\u2026 Even if it\\u2019s to be of service to someone\\u2026 There\\u2019s no life that should be lost for that! Yeah! Run! Sakura! Pervy Sage! Sorry to be late! I was faced with a number of obstacles on my end too! Gimme a break\\u2026 Now then\\u2026 Climb on, climb on! Hurry! Let\\u2019s get back above ground! Oops! Sasame! She\\u2019s fine\\u2026 She just fainted. Naruto! Orochimaru assigned us a mission\\u2026 To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back to the Village Hidden in the Leaves under any circumstances! Then, Sasuke is\\u2026?! Yeah\\u2026 He\\u2019s alive! Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke because he is his vital vessel which he will possess in three years! Arashi\\u2026 Arashi\\u2026 This place is gonna collapse! Hurry up and come over here! I\\u2019m already just a puppet\\u2026 I cannot live my life anywhere except here. Arashi\\u2026 All right! No! Arashi! Sasame\\u2026 Thank you. Including Arashi, we\\u2019ve paid an extraordinary price but\\u2026 The Fuma Clan has been able to cut itself free from Orochimaru\\u2019s spell\\u2026 You can start again anew. I will rebuild the Clan again without fail! With this life\\u2026 that Arashi protected. Yeah! I am truly indebted to you. Sasame\\u2026 Hanzaki, I\\u2019m leaving these two in your hands! Yes, sir! Please take care along the road! I will. \\u2013 Thank you! \\u2013 We thank you! \\u2013 Take care! \\u2013 See you again! Hey! Hang in there! Well, we weren\\u2019t able to find Sasuke, but at least we now know that he\\u2019s alive somewhere\\u2026 We\\u2019ll have to settle for the fact that we were able to ascertain the new information that we still have a grace period of three years before he becomes a vessel to be possessed by Orochimaru. Yes\\u2026 Sasame knew what she needed to do for her clan\\u2026 But this time again all I did was cry. All I did was depend on Naruto\\u2026 Sakura! You gave your best effort too! No, I was just a ball and chain to everyone\\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t capable of doing anything alone\\u2026 That\\u2019s not true! Seeing you give your best effort like that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura. If you hadn\\u2019t been there, Sakura, I\\u2019d have been crushed just like that. It\\u2019s thanks to you, Sakura! Naruto\\u2026 Wow, you\\u2019ve grown into someone who can say that sort of thing! Oww! I\\u2019m an injured man! Treat me with a little more care! Oh yeah, that\\u2019s right! All I was thinking about at that time was protecting someone I cared about\\u2026 What I\\u2019m capable of doing right now\\u2026 I was thinking\\u2026 What? There are many variables such as mission level, or platoon\\u2019s member structure\\u2026 But no matter how small a platoon might be, I think it\\u2019s important to assign one Medical Ninja to it\\u2026 I know that already\\u2026 I wrote exactly the same thing in a report long ago regarding the survival rate and mission achievement rate of small platoons. But it\\u2019s not that easy to nurture Medical Ninja. They require a different set of skills than that of fighting types Ninja\\u2026 The minute perfection of Chakra control, the ability to assimilate a huge volume of specialized knowledge, the brains to apply that in a broad way\\u2026 patience\\u2026 And there is the most important thing for Shinobi who are to develop into a Medical Ninja\\u2026 Well, I\\u2019m busy right now, so\\u2026 The most important thing\\u2026huh? Hidden Leaf Hospital \\t\\t I\\u2019m all wrapped up in bandages again\\u2026 This way I can\\u2019t even hold chopsticks\\u2026 Sakura, when it\\u2019s time for my meal, feed me, okay? I\\u2019ll open up my mouth just like this and\\u2026 Huh? Sakura? I\\u2019m sorry! I was just joking! I\\u2019m sorry\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026 Huh? This is gonna mean that I\\u2019ll keep you waiting a little but\\u2026 Next time, I definitely won\\u2019t\\u2026 be a ball-and-chain to you! Huh? Enter! I came here with a request! What is it? Please make me your apprentice! You\\u2019re very desperate, aren\\u2019t you? Sakura Haruno, I heard from Kakashi that you have a brilliant mind as well as will power! All right. But in exchange, I\\u2019m not gonna be easy on you! Yes, ma\\u2019am! This recent mission\\u2026 looks like it wasn\\u2019t wasted on her, after all. When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though I had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands A droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words I\\u2019ll keep these thoughts\\u2026 He makes me so angry, that Pervy Sage! Didn\\u2019t he say \\u201cI\\u2019ll make you my disciple and hone your skills\\u201d?! When Sakura\\u2019s already become the Old Lady Tsunade's and is working so hard! And he just leaves me to my own devices! Hey! All because he was assigned a mission by Old Lady Tsunade! If things come to this, I\\u2019m gonna give the Old Lady Tsunade a piece of my mind!

              "'A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails. With its powerful tails, it could smash mountains and create tidal waves. A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack. We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here! We can\\'t let it get any closer to our village! One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster, but died in the process. This Ninja was known as… the Fourth Hokage. Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?! You\\'re really gonna get it this time! I don\\'t care! You know your problem? You can\\'t do the things I do! Only I can do this! I\\'m better than all of you! Believe it! There\\'s a problem, sir! Lord Hokage! What is it? Did that Naruto do something again? Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images… And he vandalized and graffitied all over them! Wait! Ha ha… Why should I? Hey, Naruto! How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei? The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now? Now listen, Naruto. You failed the last graduation test and the one before that. This is no time to be goofing off, you fool! We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu! Even those who already passed will take it! Whaaaat?! Sakura Haruno. Here I go… Transform! OK! I did it! Cha! Did you see that, Sasuke? Next, Sasuke Uchiha. Yes. O-OK. Next, Naruto Uzumaki. This is a real pain. And it\\'s all your fault. Like I care!! OK… Good luck, Naruto… Transform! How was it? I call it the \"Sexy Jutsu\"! You fool! Stop making idiotic spells! Darn… Darn… I won\\'t let you go home unless you clean that all up. I don\\'t care… There\\'s nobody home anyway. Naruto... What is it this time? What I meant was… If you clean up all that mess, I\\'ll buy you ramen tonight. Huh?! Yes! I-I will finish it no time! Enter: Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto. Why did you vandalize those faces? Don\\'t you know who the Hokage leaders are? Of course, I do! I know they earned the title Lord Hokage because they were the best Ninja of their time, right? Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox. Then why did you do that? Because I\\'ll become a Hokage myself. And I\\'ll be the greatest Hokage of all time! So that everyone will finally learn to accept me! By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask. You want another bowl? Mmmm…No… Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while? This? No no! This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy. Tomorrow, you will… You\\'re so mean! So that\\'s why you took off your goggles… Humph... One more bowl please! We are now about to begin the graduation test. When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom. The test is on the Clone Jutsu. Oh no… Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu! But still… I will do it no matter what! Clone Jutsu! Disqualified! Iruka Sensei. His physical coordination and stamina are excellent. And he managed to come up with something. Isn\\'t that enough for him to pass? Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones. Naruto created just one. And it\\'s practically useless. I can\\'t give him a passing mark. I \\'m a Ninja now! You did well. That\\'s my son. Congratulations for your graduation. I\\'ll cook something good tonight! Look at that one. It\\'s that boy. I hear he\\'s the only one who failed. Serves him right. Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja. Isn\\'t that the boy who is actually… Hey! We\\'re not supposed to talk about that. Iruka. We need to talk later. Yes, sir. Iruka Sensei isn\\'t trying to be mean to you. Then why only me? He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart. You both don\\'t have parents. But I really wanted to graduate. Heh... I guess I have no choice… I\\'ll let you in on a big secret. Secret? Iruka. What is it, Lord Hokage? I know how you feel. But… Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents…like you. Let me go! My mom and dad are still out there fighting! Wake up, Iruka Sensei! What\\'s the matter? Come to Lord Hokage\\'s immediately! I heard that Naruto… stole the Scroll of Sealing. The Scroll of Sealing?! Let\\'s see… The first Jutsu is… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu? What?! Already a Jutsu I\\'m no good at? Lord Hokage! We can\\'t forgive him! This is not just a prank! The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed! Depending on its use… It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village! Yes. Bring Naruto here at once! Yes, sir! Where did you go…Naruto? I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto… Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine! Hey you, Naruto! You found me.. And I\\'ve only learned one Jutsu. He\\'s been practicing the Jutsu… until he\\'s become this exhausted and dirty…? Listen, listen! I\\'m gonna show you this amazing Jutsu! You\\'re gonna let me graduate if I can do it! Isn\\'t it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here? Who told you that? Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place… Mizuki did?! I\\'m impressed you found this place. I see now…how it is. Naruto, give me that scroll. Wait, wait… What\\'s going on here? Naruto! Never give him that scroll! It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed. Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself! W-Wha--? Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll! Huh? What are you saying, Mizuki! Don\\'t let him fool you, Naruto! I will tell you the truth. Idiot! Don\\'t do that! After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created. A rule? That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows. Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it? Stop it, Mizuki! The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit! Huh? You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, who killed Iruka\\'s parents and destroyed our village! Stop it! Everyone has been deceiving you ever since. Didn\\'t you find it strange? Why everyone hated you so much? No! No! No! No! No! Naruto… Nobody accepts you. That\\'s why Iruka hates you so much! Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents. Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened. That\\'s why he keeps misbehaving. It\\'s the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement. He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting. Die, Naruto! Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down! Why…? Because you and I are the same. After my parents died, nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support. I wasn\\'t a good student in school. I was the class clown… because I wanted people to notice me. I couldn\\'t get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things. It was so hard. Isn\\'t that right, Naruto? You felt so lonely…right? And you suffered inside, right? I\\'m sorry, Naruto…. If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn\\'t have suffered so much. Don\\'t make me laugh! Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents! He\\'s just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back! Naruto! Narutoooooo! He is not the type of kid who will change his mind. He will take revenge against our village using that scroll! Didn\\'t you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox. No… Naruto…isn\\'t…like that at all! All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll. I\\'ll take care of you later! I-I won\\'t let you… Well, well. Mizuki has a big mouth! Naruto feels worse than he\\'s ever felt. He might unleash the power locked up inside him. The Scroll of Sealing is now with him. There\\'s a slight chance he might actually release the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him! If that happens… I\\'ve found him! Naruto! Everything that Mizuki said was a lie! Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll! It can\\'t be… Why is it, Naruto? How… did you know I wasn\\'t Iruka…? Because I\\'m Iruka. I see. What\\'s in it for you to protect the one who killed your family? I\\'m not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll! You\\'re the idiot. Naruto is the same as me. Same? Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll. There is no way that that monster… that Fox Spirit, won\\'t take advantage of the power of that scroll! You\\'re right… I guess it was true all along! See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all! ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit. But Naruto is different! I know that he is an exceptional student. He works very hard, and he\\'s single-minded and clumsy at the same time. No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering. He is not the Demon Fox Spirit. He\\'s Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves! You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka! I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind. Die! I guess this is the end for me… Naruto?! You surprised me there, freak. If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I\\'ll kill you! Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow! Why don\\'t you try then? I\\'ll strike you back a thousand-fold! Let\\'s see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! You\\'ve… Those aren\\'t just images but actual clones! That\\'s an advanced Ninjutsu! What\\'s this…? What\\'s the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC\\'mon! Weren\\'t you gonna get me with one blow? Here! In that case… I\\'ll come to you. I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay? Yeah. He\\'s really something. Maybe it is true. Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders… Naruto, come over here. I\\'d like to give you something. Has anyone found Naruto yet? No. Darn, this is going to be bad… There\\'s no need to worry anymore. Lord Hokage! He\\'ll be back soon. Sensei, how much longer? OK, you may open your eyes now. Congratulations…on your graduation. In celebration, we\\'ll have ramen tonight! Iruka Sensei! That hurts! Naruto… I was going to lecture to you... that the road gets more difficult now that you\\'re a Ninja. But I guess I\\'ll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand… W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me! You\\'re smaller than me and you\\'re saying that you\\'re gonna become the Fifth Hokage? I don\\'t care if you are the 3rd Hokage\\'s grandson or not. It\\'s not that easy to be a Hokage! If you want it that bad, you\\'re gonna have to beat me first! Next episode:  \"My Name Is Konohamaru!\" Watch my outstanding performance!'"

Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Hey, you! Are you sure you want to look like that? Yes, of course! C'mon! So hurry hurry! Don't regret it later. Say cheese! My Name Is Konohamaru! I couldn't decide on how to look. It took me 3 hours to decide. But as you can see, it's more like a work of art. Doesn't it look great? Take it over. What?! Take it over. Stop saying that! Transform! Oh please, Lord Hokage\\u2026 The Sexy Jutsu\\u2026 That's quite a devious technique. By the way Naruto, where's your headband? I won't wear it until the orientation. lt might get scratched Well, that's just fine. But the Ninja Registration Form is a very important document held in high regard by our village. Why do you want to look like this? Because! Anyway, how should I know about all that stuff? Old man! Get ready to fight! I am going to be the Fifth Hokage! Ouch! If it's not one thing, it's another\\u2026. Drat! Is this a trap? Are you okay, Honorable Grandson? May I just inform you that there aren't any traps here\\u2026 Huh? What's with this runt? What?! I know this kid\\u2026 He's that Nine-Tailed boy! He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel! You must have done this to me! You tripped all by yourself, stupid! Hey! Let go of him! He is the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage! He stopped as soon as he learned who I am\\u2026. He's like my four-eyed teacher. He's just like everyone else! What's the matter? Weren't you gonna hit me, huh? Can't do it 'cuz I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh? As if I care! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlmbecile! This guy\\u2026 What?! Good grief\\u2026 Listen to me. You are the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage. Even though that scoundrel hit you, you must not associate with his kind. Nothing good will come of your tangling with him. This is your distinguished teacher Ebisu, and I am never wrong about these things! Don't you want to become the Fifth Hokage? Then allow me to teach you Ninjutsu, so that your dream will become a reality. That's right. Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage. Is that clear, Honorable Grandson? He's gone! It seems he's gone after Naruto. Oh no! This is terrible! Honorable Grandson! How did he become like this? That was the 20th sneak attack today. And now he's in the company of Naruto. I'm a bit worried. I just hope he doesn't pick up more foolishness. Huh? Stop following me! What is it now?! Your camouflage is pathetic. You've seen through my disguise... Your reputation is well-earned. I will allow you to make me your apprentice. But you must first teach me that  \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"  technique you used to beat Grandpa Hokage. You gotta be kidding. I beg you to say yes, boss! Huh? Boss? Boss! Boss! Boss! I guess I have no choice. Listen. In order to become a skilled Ninja, you must first learn to control your Chatora. Chatora? Yes, Chatora. Boss, I think you mean Chakra. Silence! That's what real Ninjas call it! Oh! I didn't know that! Whew\\u2026 I'm glad he's a fool. Listen. Chakra essentially means\\u2026 Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu. Huh? In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra, the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience. This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs. You made me think you knew all that, when you were just reading from a scroll! Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques, but it really boils down to just one thing. And what is that? Hard work and guts. Hard work and guts? That's right. So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you. Yes, boss! Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me. Huh? Let me see first how much you already know. But what do I transform into? OK... First, transform into that lady. An easy task, boss. Transform! Well, do I look like her? Uhm\\u2026 Well, the clothes do and\\u2026 And what's so similar about that?! Honorable Grandson. If you will transform into me, at least try to look a little cuter, OK? She's scary! Why am I the one who gets hit? OK! Next, we'll do some research on sexiness! Yes, boss! I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto! This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it! Yes, boss! Transform! Naruto! It's you again! Why is it always me\\u2026? Sorry. Huh? It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson. Don't worry about it. Huh? You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu! You just need more practice. Yes, boss! OK, keep in mind\\u2026 the point is for \\\"boom boom boom\\\"! Now do it! Yes, boss! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTransform! What do you think? That won't do! More slender. Yes, boss! Is this okay? Not yet. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore attractive. Yes, boss! How about now? That Naruto\\u2026 What is he teaching the Honorable Grandson\\u2026? Where the hell could they be\\u2026? I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage. All those who interfere will be eliminated. You know I've been wondering\\u2026 You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage. My name is Konohamaru. It was Grandpa who gave me that name. He named me after our village. It should be easy for everyone here to remember. But nobody ever calls me by that name. When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage. No one sees me for who I really am. I can't stand it anymore. That's why\\u2026 That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now. Idiot\\u2026Who do you think will accept you, huh? Huh? You won't win the title that easily, you know. What?! It's not that simple. If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord Hokage\\u2026 What? You'll have to beat me first! Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you. Iruka. Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form? Yes. When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand, he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja. He's been happy since then. It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream. Huh? As you well know, only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto. I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident. I have severely punished those who have broken this rule. Now our children know nothing about it. That is the only positive development for Naruto. Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died, his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero. A hero? The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby whose umbilical cord had just been cut. As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, Naruto saved the village. Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that. Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself. Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children. Iruka. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDo you know? What, sir? When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence, he sees it in the eyes of the people around him. I have found you! Huh? That Demon Fox!! That cold look! lt's always like that! Honorable Grandson, we have to go now. No way! I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage! Don't get in my way! A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith, judgment, obedience and all that. He must be skilled at more than thousand techniques\\u2026 And then... Transform! Take this! Sexy Jutsu! What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work! What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?! I am a gentleman! Such vulgar attacks will never work on me! Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile! Stick with me and... you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage. C'mon, let's go! No way! Shadow Clone Jutsu Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic! Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing. I am a distinguished teacher. I am not as weak as Mizuki. Boss\\u2026 Transform! Transform! Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026 I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"! He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu. That's another devious attack. I probably won't even survive that one. I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine! I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody! But I keep failing. You think it's that easy? Huh? It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village. Everybody must learn to believe in you. I've been through a lot already. It's been one struggle after another. But after all that, I found someone who accepts me. I had to go through a lot... Just for one person. You had better push yourself. For what? The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one. There's no such thing as a shortcut. If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage You'll have to beat me first. Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that? I won't be your apprentice anymore. From now on, you're my rival. Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy. Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage. Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru. You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja. Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke? The guy I hate the most? Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\" and doesn't even pay attention to me! It makes me so mad! I got it! I'm going to pull one on him! I'm not gonna let him be so cool in front of Sakura! Next Episode:  \\\"Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?\\\" Watch my outstanding performance!\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails. With its powerful tails, it could smash mountains and create tidal waves. A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack. We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here! We can't let it get any closer to our village! One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster, but died in the process. This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage. Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?! You're really gonna get it this time! I don't care! You know your problem? You can't do the things I do! Only I can do this! I'm better than all of you! Believe it! There's a problem, sir! Lord Hokage! What is it? Did that Naruto do something again? Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images\\u2026 And he vandalized and graffitied all over them! Wait! Ha ha\\u2026 Why should I? Hey, Naruto! How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei? The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now? Now listen, Naruto. You failed the last graduation test and the one before that. This is no time to be goofing off, you fool! We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu! Even those who already passed will take it! Whaaaat?! Sakura Haruno. Here I go\\u2026 Transform! OK! I did it! Cha! Did you see that, Sasuke? Next, Sasuke Uchiha. Yes. O-OK. Next, Naruto Uzumaki. This is a real pain. And it's all your fault. Like I care!! OK\\u2026 Good luck, Naruto\\u2026 Transform! How was it? I call it the \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"! You fool! Stop making idiotic spells! Darn\\u2026 Darn\\u2026 I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up. I don't care\\u2026 There's nobody home anyway. Naruto... What is it this time? What I meant was\\u2026 If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight. Huh?! Yes! I-I will finish it no time! Enter: Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto. Why did you vandalize those faces? Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are? Of course, I do! I know they earned the title Lord Hokage because they were the best Ninja of their time, right? Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox. Then why did you do that? Because I'll become a Hokage myself. And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time! So that everyone will finally learn to accept me! By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask. You want another bowl? Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026 Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while? This? No no! This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy. Tomorrow, you will\\u2026 You're so mean! So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026 Humph... One more bowl please! We are now about to begin the graduation test. When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom. The test is on the Clone Jutsu. Oh no\\u2026 Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu! But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what! Clone Jutsu! Disqualified! Iruka Sensei. His physical coordination and stamina are excellent. And he managed to come up with something. Isn't that enough for him to pass? Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones. Naruto created just one. And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark. I 'm a Ninja now! You did well. That's my son. Congratulations for your graduation. I'll cook something good tonight! Look at that one. It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed. Serves him right. Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja. Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026 Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that. Iruka. We need to talk later. Yes, sir. Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you. Then why only me? He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart. You both don't have parents. But I really wanted to graduate. Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026 I'll let you in on a big secret. Secret? Iruka. What is it, Lord Hokage? I know how you feel. But\\u2026 Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you. Let me go! My mom and dad are still out there fighting! Wake up, Iruka Sensei! What's the matter? Come to Lord Hokage's immediately! I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing. The Scroll of Sealing?! Let's see\\u2026 The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu? What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at? Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him! This is not just a prank! The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed! Depending on its use\\u2026 It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village! Yes. Bring Naruto here at once! Yes, sir! Where did you go\\u2026Naruto? I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026 Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine! Hey you, Naruto! You found me.. And I've only learned one Jutsu. He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026 until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026? Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu! You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it! Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here? Who told you that? Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026 Mizuki did?! I'm impressed you found this place. I see now\\u2026how it is. Naruto, give me that scroll. Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here? Naruto! Never give him that scroll! It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed. Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself! W-Wha--? Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll! Huh? What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto! I will tell you the truth. Idiot! Don't do that! After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created. A rule? That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows. Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it? Stop it, Mizuki! The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit! Huh? You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village! Stop it! Everyone has been deceiving you ever since. Didn't you find it strange? Why everyone hated you so much? No! No! No! No! No! Naruto\\u2026 Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much! Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents. Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened. That's why he keeps misbehaving. It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement. He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting. Die, Naruto! Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down! Why\\u2026? Because you and I are the same. After my parents died, nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support. I wasn't a good student in school. I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me. I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things. It was so hard. Isn't that right, Naruto? You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right? I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026. If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much. Don't make me laugh! Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents! He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back! Naruto! Narutoooooo! He is not the type of kid who will change his mind. He will take revenge against our village using that scroll! Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox. No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all! All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll. I'll take care of you later! I-I won't let you\\u2026 Well, well. Mizuki has a big mouth! Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt. He might unleash the power locked up inside him. The Scroll of Sealing is now with him. There's a slight chance he might actually release the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him! If that happens\\u2026 I've found him! Naruto! Everything that Mizuki said was a lie! Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll! It can't be\\u2026 Why is it, Naruto? How\\u2026 did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026? Because I'm Iruka. I see. What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family? I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll! You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me. Same? Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll. There is no way that that monster\\u2026 that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll! You're right\\u2026 I guess it was true all along! See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all! ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit. But Naruto is different! I know that he is an exceptional student. He works very hard, and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time. No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering. He is not the Demon Fox Spirit. He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves! You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka! I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind. Die! I guess this is the end for me\\u2026 Naruto?! You surprised me there, freak. If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you! Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow! Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold! Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! You've\\u2026 Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu! What's this\\u2026? What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon! Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here! In that case\\u2026 I'll come to you. I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay? Yeah. He's really something. Maybe it is true. Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders\\u2026 Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something. Has anyone found Naruto yet? No. Darn, this is going to be bad\\u2026 There's no need to worry anymore. Lord Hokage! He'll be back soon. Sensei, how much longer? OK, you may open your eyes now. Congratulations\\u2026on your graduation. In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight! Iruka Sensei! That hurts! Naruto\\u2026 I was going to lecture to you... that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja. But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand\\u2026 W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me! You're smaller than me and you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage? I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not. It's not that easy to be a Hokage! If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!

Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Hey, you! Are you sure you want to look like that? Yes, of course! C'mon! So hurry hurry! Don't regret it later. Say cheese! My Name Is Konohamaru! I couldn't decide on how to look. It took me 3 hours to decide. But as you can see, it's more like a work of art. Doesn't it look great? Take it over. What?! Take it over. Stop saying that! Transform! Oh please, Lord Hokage\\u2026 The Sexy Jutsu\\u2026 That's quite a devious technique. By the way Naruto, where's your headband? I won't wear it until the orientation. lt might get scratched Well, that's just fine. But the Ninja Registration Form is a very important document held in high regard by our village. Why do you want to look like this? Because! Anyway, how should I know about all that stuff? Old man! Get ready to fight! I am going to be the Fifth Hokage! Ouch! If it's not one thing, it's another\\u2026. Drat! Is this a trap? Are you okay, Honorable Grandson? May I just inform you that there aren't any traps here\\u2026 Huh? What's with this runt? What?! I know this kid\\u2026 He's that Nine-Tailed boy! He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel! You must have done this to me! You tripped all by yourself, stupid! Hey! Let go of him! He is the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage! He stopped as soon as he learned who I am\\u2026. He's like my four-eyed teacher. He's just like everyone else! What's the matter? Weren't you gonna hit me, huh? Can't do it 'cuz I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh? As if I care! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlmbecile! This guy\\u2026 What?! Good grief\\u2026 Listen to me. You are the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage. Even though that scoundrel hit you, you must not associate with his kind. Nothing good will come of your tangling with him. This is your distinguished teacher Ebisu, and I am never wrong about these things! Don't you want to become the Fifth Hokage? Then allow me to teach you Ninjutsu, so that your dream will become a reality. That's right. Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage. Is that clear, Honorable Grandson? He's gone! It seems he's gone after Naruto. Oh no! This is terrible! Honorable Grandson! How did he become like this? That was the 20th sneak attack today. And now he's in the company of Naruto. I'm a bit worried. I just hope he doesn't pick up more foolishness. Huh? Stop following me! What is it now?! Your camouflage is pathetic. You've seen through my disguise... Your reputation is well-earned. I will allow you to make me your apprentice. But you must first teach me that  \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"  technique you used to beat Grandpa Hokage. You gotta be kidding. I beg you to say yes, boss! Huh? Boss? Boss! Boss! Boss! I guess I have no choice. Listen. In order to become a skilled Ninja, you must first learn to control your Chatora. Chatora? Yes, Chatora. Boss, I think you mean Chakra. Silence! That's what real Ninjas call it! Oh! I didn't know that! Whew\\u2026 I'm glad he's a fool. Listen. Chakra essentially means\\u2026 Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu. Huh? In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra, the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience. This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs. You made me think you knew all that, when you were just reading from a scroll! Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques, but it really boils down to just one thing. And what is that? Hard work and guts. Hard work and guts? That's right. So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you. Yes, boss! Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me. Huh? Let me see first how much you already know. But what do I transform into? OK... First, transform into that lady. An easy task, boss. Transform! Well, do I look like her? Uhm\\u2026 Well, the clothes do and\\u2026 And what's so similar about that?! Honorable Grandson. If you will transform into me, at least try to look a little cuter, OK? She's scary! Why am I the one who gets hit? OK! Next, we'll do some research on sexiness! Yes, boss! I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto! This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it! Yes, boss! Transform! Naruto! It's you again! Why is it always me\\u2026? Sorry. Huh? It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson. Don't worry about it. Huh? You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu! You just need more practice. Yes, boss! OK, keep in mind\\u2026 the point is for \\\"boom boom boom\\\"! Now do it! Yes, boss! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTransform! What do you think? That won't do! More slender. Yes, boss! Is this okay? Not yet. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore attractive. Yes, boss! How about now? That Naruto\\u2026 What is he teaching the Honorable Grandson\\u2026? Where the hell could they be\\u2026? I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage. All those who interfere will be eliminated. You know I've been wondering\\u2026 You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage. My name is Konohamaru. It was Grandpa who gave me that name. He named me after our village. It should be easy for everyone here to remember. But nobody ever calls me by that name. When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage. No one sees me for who I really am. I can't stand it anymore. That's why\\u2026 That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now. Idiot\\u2026Who do you think will accept you, huh? Huh? You won't win the title that easily, you know. What?! It's not that simple. If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord Hokage\\u2026 What? You'll have to beat me first! Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you. Iruka. Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form? Yes. When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand, he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja. He's been happy since then. It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream. Huh? As you well know, only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto. I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident. I have severely punished those who have broken this rule. Now our children know nothing about it. That is the only positive development for Naruto. Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died, his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero. A hero? The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby whose umbilical cord had just been cut. As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, Naruto saved the village. Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that. Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself. Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children. Iruka. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDo you know? What, sir? When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence, he sees it in the eyes of the people around him. I have found you! Huh? That Demon Fox!! That cold look! lt's always like that! Honorable Grandson, we have to go now. No way! I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage! Don't get in my way! A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith, judgment, obedience and all that. He must be skilled at more than thousand techniques\\u2026 And then... Transform! Take this! Sexy Jutsu! What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work! What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?! I am a gentleman! Such vulgar attacks will never work on me! Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile! Stick with me and... you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage. C'mon, let's go! No way! Shadow Clone Jutsu Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic! Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing. I am a distinguished teacher. I am not as weak as Mizuki. Boss\\u2026 Transform! Transform! Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026 I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"! He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu. That's another devious attack. I probably won't even survive that one. I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine! I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody! But I keep failing. You think it's that easy? Huh? It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village. Everybody must learn to believe in you. I've been through a lot already. It's been one struggle after another. But after all that, I found someone who accepts me. I had to go through a lot... Just for one person. You had better push yourself. For what? The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one. There's no such thing as a shortcut. If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage You'll have to beat me first. Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that? I won't be your apprentice anymore. From now on, you're my rival. Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy. Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage. Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru. You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja. Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke? The guy I hate the most? Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\" and doesn't even pay attention to me! It makes me so mad! I got it! I'm going to pull one on him! I'm not gonna let him be so cool in front of Sakura! Next Episode:  \\\"Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?\\\" Watch my outstanding performance!\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails. With its powerful tails, it could smash mountains and create tidal waves. A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack. We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here! We can't let it get any closer to our village! One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster, but died in the process. This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage. Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?! You're really gonna get it this time! I don't care! You know your problem? You can't do the things I do! Only I can do this! I'm better than all of you! Believe it! There's a problem, sir! Lord Hokage! What is it? Did that Naruto do something again? Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images\\u2026 And he vandalized and graffitied all over them! Wait! Ha ha\\u2026 Why should I? Hey, Naruto! How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei? The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now? Now listen, Naruto. You failed the last graduation test and the one before that. This is no time to be goofing off, you fool! We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu! Even those who already passed will take it! Whaaaat?! Sakura Haruno. Here I go\\u2026 Transform! OK! I did it! Cha! Did you see that, Sasuke? Next, Sasuke Uchiha. Yes. O-OK. Next, Naruto Uzumaki. This is a real pain. And it's all your fault. Like I care!! OK\\u2026 Good luck, Naruto\\u2026 Transform! How was it? I call it the \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"! You fool! Stop making idiotic spells! Darn\\u2026 Darn\\u2026 I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up. I don't care\\u2026 There's nobody home anyway. Naruto... What is it this time? What I meant was\\u2026 If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight. Huh?! Yes! I-I will finish it no time! Enter: Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto. Why did you vandalize those faces? Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are? Of course, I do! I know they earned the title Lord Hokage because they were the best Ninja of their time, right? Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox. Then why did you do that? Because I'll become a Hokage myself. And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time! So that everyone will finally learn to accept me! By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask. You want another bowl? Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026 Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while? This? No no! This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy. Tomorrow, you will\\u2026 You're so mean! So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026 Humph... One more bowl please! We are now about to begin the graduation test. When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom. The test is on the Clone Jutsu. Oh no\\u2026 Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu! But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what! Clone Jutsu! Disqualified! Iruka Sensei. His physical coordination and stamina are excellent. And he managed to come up with something. Isn't that enough for him to pass? Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones. Naruto created just one. And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark. I 'm a Ninja now! You did well. That's my son. Congratulations for your graduation. I'll cook something good tonight! Look at that one. It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed. Serves him right. Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja. Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026 Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that. Iruka. We need to talk later. Yes, sir. Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you. Then why only me? He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart. You both don't have parents. But I really wanted to graduate. Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026 I'll let you in on a big secret. Secret? Iruka. What is it, Lord Hokage? I know how you feel. But\\u2026 Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you. Let me go! My mom and dad are still out there fighting! Wake up, Iruka Sensei! What's the matter? Come to Lord Hokage's immediately! I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing. The Scroll of Sealing?! Let's see\\u2026 The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu? What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at? Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him! This is not just a prank! The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed! Depending on its use\\u2026 It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village! Yes. Bring Naruto here at once! Yes, sir! Where did you go\\u2026Naruto? I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026 Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine! Hey you, Naruto! You found me.. And I've only learned one Jutsu. He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026 until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026? Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu! You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it! Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here? Who told you that? Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026 Mizuki did?! I'm impressed you found this place. I see now\\u2026how it is. Naruto, give me that scroll. Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here? Naruto! Never give him that scroll! It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed. Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself! W-Wha--? Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll! Huh? What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto! I will tell you the truth. Idiot! Don't do that! After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created. A rule? That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows. Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it? Stop it, Mizuki! The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit! Huh? You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village! Stop it! Everyone has been deceiving you ever since. Didn't you find it strange? Why everyone hated you so much? No! No! No! No! No! Naruto\\u2026 Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much! Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents. Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened. That's why he keeps misbehaving. It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement. He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting. Die, Naruto! Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down! Why\\u2026? Because you and I are the same. After my parents died, nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support. I wasn't a good student in school. I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me. I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things. It was so hard. Isn't that right, Naruto? You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right? I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026. If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much. Don't make me laugh! Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents! He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back! Naruto! Narutoooooo! He is not the type of kid who will change his mind. He will take revenge against our village using that scroll! Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox. No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all! All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll. I'll take care of you later! I-I won't let you\\u2026 Well, well. Mizuki has a big mouth! Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt. He might unleash the power locked up inside him. The Scroll of Sealing is now with him. There's a slight chance he might actually release the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him! If that happens\\u2026 I've found him! Naruto! Everything that Mizuki said was a lie! Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll! It can't be\\u2026 Why is it, Naruto? How\\u2026 did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026? Because I'm Iruka. I see. What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family? I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll! You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me. Same? Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll. There is no way that that monster\\u2026 that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll! You're right\\u2026 I guess it was true all along! See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all! ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit. But Naruto is different! I know that he is an exceptional student. He works very hard, and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time. No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering. He is not the Demon Fox Spirit. He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves! You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka! I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind. Die! I guess this is the end for me\\u2026 Naruto?! You surprised me there, freak. If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you! Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow! Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold! Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! You've\\u2026 Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu! What's this\\u2026? What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon! Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here! In that case\\u2026 I'll come to you. I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay? Yeah. He's really something. Maybe it is true. Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders\\u2026 Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something. Has anyone found Naruto yet? No. Darn, this is going to be bad\\u2026 There's no need to worry anymore. Lord Hokage! He'll be back soon. Sensei, how much longer? OK, you may open your eyes now. Congratulations\\u2026on your graduation. In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight! Iruka Sensei! That hurts! Naruto\\u2026 I was going to lecture to you... that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja. But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand\\u2026 W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me! You're smaller than me and you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage? I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not. It's not that easy to be a Hokage! If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!

Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Hey, you! Are you sure you want to look like that? Yes, of course! C'mon! So hurry hurry! Don't regret it later. Say cheese! My Name Is Konohamaru! I couldn't decide on how to look. It took me 3 hours to decide. But as you can see, it's more like a work of art. Doesn't it look great? Take it over. What?! Take it over. Stop saying that! Transform! Oh please, Lord Hokage\\u2026 The Sexy Jutsu\\u2026 That's quite a devious technique. By the way Naruto, where's your headband? I won't wear it until the orientation. lt might get scratched Well, that's just fine. But the Ninja Registration Form is a very important document held in high regard by our village. Why do you want to look like this? Because! Anyway, how should I know about all that stuff? Old man! Get ready to fight! I am going to be the Fifth Hokage! Ouch! If it's not one thing, it's another\\u2026. Drat! Is this a trap? Are you okay, Honorable Grandson? May I just inform you that there aren't any traps here\\u2026 Huh? What's with this runt? What?! I know this kid\\u2026 He's that Nine-Tailed boy! He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel! You must have done this to me! You tripped all by yourself, stupid! Hey! Let go of him! He is the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage! He stopped as soon as he learned who I am\\u2026. He's like my four-eyed teacher. He's just like everyone else! What's the matter? Weren't you gonna hit me, huh? Can't do it 'cuz I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh? As if I care! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlmbecile! This guy\\u2026 What?! Good grief\\u2026 Listen to me. You are the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage. Even though that scoundrel hit you, you must not associate with his kind. Nothing good will come of your tangling with him. This is your distinguished teacher Ebisu, and I am never wrong about these things! Don't you want to become the Fifth Hokage? Then allow me to teach you Ninjutsu, so that your dream will become a reality. That's right. Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage. Is that clear, Honorable Grandson? He's gone! It seems he's gone after Naruto. Oh no! This is terrible! Honorable Grandson! How did he become like this? That was the 20th sneak attack today. And now he's in the company of Naruto. I'm a bit worried. I just hope he doesn't pick up more foolishness. Huh? Stop following me! What is it now?! Your camouflage is pathetic. You've seen through my disguise... Your reputation is well-earned. I will allow you to make me your apprentice. But you must first teach me that  \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"  technique you used to beat Grandpa Hokage. You gotta be kidding. I beg you to say yes, boss! Huh? Boss? Boss! Boss! Boss! I guess I have no choice. Listen. In order to become a skilled Ninja, you must first learn to control your Chatora. Chatora? Yes, Chatora. Boss, I think you mean Chakra. Silence! That's what real Ninjas call it! Oh! I didn't know that! Whew\\u2026 I'm glad he's a fool. Listen. Chakra essentially means\\u2026 Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu. Huh? In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra, the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience. This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs. You made me think you knew all that, when you were just reading from a scroll! Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques, but it really boils down to just one thing. And what is that? Hard work and guts. Hard work and guts? That's right. So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you. Yes, boss! Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me. Huh? Let me see first how much you already know. But what do I transform into? OK... First, transform into that lady. An easy task, boss. Transform! Well, do I look like her? Uhm\\u2026 Well, the clothes do and\\u2026 And what's so similar about that?! Honorable Grandson. If you will transform into me, at least try to look a little cuter, OK? She's scary! Why am I the one who gets hit? OK! Next, we'll do some research on sexiness! Yes, boss! I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto! This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it! Yes, boss! Transform! Naruto! It's you again! Why is it always me\\u2026? Sorry. Huh? It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson. Don't worry about it. Huh? You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu! You just need more practice. Yes, boss! OK, keep in mind\\u2026 the point is for \\\"boom boom boom\\\"! Now do it! Yes, boss! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTransform! What do you think? That won't do! More slender. Yes, boss! Is this okay? Not yet. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore attractive. Yes, boss! How about now? That Naruto\\u2026 What is he teaching the Honorable Grandson\\u2026? Where the hell could they be\\u2026? I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage. All those who interfere will be eliminated. You know I've been wondering\\u2026 You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage. My name is Konohamaru. It was Grandpa who gave me that name. He named me after our village. It should be easy for everyone here to remember. But nobody ever calls me by that name. When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage. No one sees me for who I really am. I can't stand it anymore. That's why\\u2026 That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now. Idiot\\u2026Who do you think will accept you, huh? Huh? You won't win the title that easily, you know. What?! It's not that simple. If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord Hokage\\u2026 What? You'll have to beat me first! Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you. Iruka. Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form? Yes. When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand, he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja. He's been happy since then. It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream. Huh? As you well know, only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto. I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident. I have severely punished those who have broken this rule. Now our children know nothing about it. That is the only positive development for Naruto. Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died, his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero. A hero? The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby whose umbilical cord had just been cut. As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, Naruto saved the village. Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that. Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself. Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children. Iruka. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDo you know? What, sir? When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence, he sees it in the eyes of the people around him. I have found you! Huh? That Demon Fox!! That cold look! lt's always like that! Honorable Grandson, we have to go now. No way! I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage! Don't get in my way! A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith, judgment, obedience and all that. He must be skilled at more than thousand techniques\\u2026 And then... Transform! Take this! Sexy Jutsu! What? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlt didn't work! What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?! I am a gentleman! Such vulgar attacks will never work on me! Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile! Stick with me and... you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage. C'mon, let's go! No way! Shadow Clone Jutsu Wow! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFantastic! Ha! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat's nothing. I am a distinguished teacher. I am not as weak as Mizuki. Boss\\u2026 Transform! Transform! Oh, Master Ebisu\\u2026 I call it \\\"the Harem Jutsu\\\"! He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu. That's another devious attack. I probably won't even survive that one. I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine! I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody! But I keep failing. You think it's that easy? Huh? It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village. Everybody must learn to believe in you. I've been through a lot already. It's been one struggle after another. But after all that, I found someone who accepts me. I had to go through a lot... Just for one person. You had better push yourself. For what? The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one. There's no such thing as a shortcut. If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage You'll have to beat me first. Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that? I won't be your apprentice anymore. From now on, you're my rival. Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy. Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage. Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru. You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja. Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke? The guy I hate the most? Sakura keeps saying  \\\"Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!\\\" and doesn't even pay attention to me! It makes me so mad! I got it! I'm going to pull one on him! I'm not gonna let him be so cool in front of Sakura! Next Episode:  \\\"Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?\\\" Watch my outstanding performance!\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails. With its powerful tails, it could smash mountains and create tidal waves. A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack. We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here! We can't let it get any closer to our village! One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster, but died in the process. This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage. Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?! You're really gonna get it this time! I don't care! You know your problem? You can't do the things I do! Only I can do this! I'm better than all of you! Believe it! There's a problem, sir! Lord Hokage! What is it? Did that Naruto do something again? Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images\\u2026 And he vandalized and graffitied all over them! Wait! Ha ha\\u2026 Why should I? Hey, Naruto! How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei? The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now? Now listen, Naruto. You failed the last graduation test and the one before that. This is no time to be goofing off, you fool! We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu! Even those who already passed will take it! Whaaaat?! Sakura Haruno. Here I go\\u2026 Transform! OK! I did it! Cha! Did you see that, Sasuke? Next, Sasuke Uchiha. Yes. O-OK. Next, Naruto Uzumaki. This is a real pain. And it's all your fault. Like I care!! OK\\u2026 Good luck, Naruto\\u2026 Transform! How was it? I call it the \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"! You fool! Stop making idiotic spells! Darn\\u2026 Darn\\u2026 I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up. I don't care\\u2026 There's nobody home anyway. Naruto... What is it this time? What I meant was\\u2026 If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight. Huh?! Yes! I-I will finish it no time! Enter: Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto. Why did you vandalize those faces? Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are? Of course, I do! I know they earned the title Lord Hokage because they were the best Ninja of their time, right? Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox. Then why did you do that? Because I'll become a Hokage myself. And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time! So that everyone will finally learn to accept me! By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask. You want another bowl? Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026 Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while? This? No no! This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy. Tomorrow, you will\\u2026 You're so mean! So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026 Humph... One more bowl please! We are now about to begin the graduation test. When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom. The test is on the Clone Jutsu. Oh no\\u2026 Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu! But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what! Clone Jutsu! Disqualified! Iruka Sensei. His physical coordination and stamina are excellent. And he managed to come up with something. Isn't that enough for him to pass? Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones. Naruto created just one. And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark. I 'm a Ninja now! You did well. That's my son. Congratulations for your graduation. I'll cook something good tonight! Look at that one. It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed. Serves him right. Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja. Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026 Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that. Iruka. We need to talk later. Yes, sir. Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you. Then why only me? He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart. You both don't have parents. But I really wanted to graduate. Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026 I'll let you in on a big secret. Secret? Iruka. What is it, Lord Hokage? I know how you feel. But\\u2026 Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you. Let me go! My mom and dad are still out there fighting! Wake up, Iruka Sensei! What's the matter? Come to Lord Hokage's immediately! I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing. The Scroll of Sealing?! Let's see\\u2026 The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu? What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at? Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him! This is not just a prank! The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed! Depending on its use\\u2026 It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village! Yes. Bring Naruto here at once! Yes, sir! Where did you go\\u2026Naruto? I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026 Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine! Hey you, Naruto! You found me.. And I've only learned one Jutsu. He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026 until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026? Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu! You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it! Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here? Who told you that? Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026 Mizuki did?! I'm impressed you found this place. I see now\\u2026how it is. Naruto, give me that scroll. Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here? Naruto! Never give him that scroll! It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed. Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself! W-Wha--? Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll! Huh? What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto! I will tell you the truth. Idiot! Don't do that! After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created. A rule? That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows. Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it? Stop it, Mizuki! The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit! Huh? You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village! Stop it! Everyone has been deceiving you ever since. Didn't you find it strange? Why everyone hated you so much? No! No! No! No! No! Naruto\\u2026 Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much! Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents. Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened. That's why he keeps misbehaving. It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement. He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting. Die, Naruto! Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down! Why\\u2026? Because you and I are the same. After my parents died, nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support. I wasn't a good student in school. I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me. I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things. It was so hard. Isn't that right, Naruto? You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right? I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026. If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much. Don't make me laugh! Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents! He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back! Naruto! Narutoooooo! He is not the type of kid who will change his mind. He will take revenge against our village using that scroll! Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox. No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all! All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll. I'll take care of you later! I-I won't let you\\u2026 Well, well. Mizuki has a big mouth! Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt. He might unleash the power locked up inside him. The Scroll of Sealing is now with him. There's a slight chance he might actually release the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him! If that happens\\u2026 I've found him! Naruto! Everything that Mizuki said was a lie! Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll! It can't be\\u2026 Why is it, Naruto? How\\u2026 did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026? Because I'm Iruka. I see. What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family? I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll! You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me. Same? Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll. There is no way that that monster\\u2026 that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll! You're right\\u2026 I guess it was true all along! See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all! ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit. But Naruto is different! I know that he is an exceptional student. He works very hard, and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time. No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering. He is not the Demon Fox Spirit. He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves! You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka! I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind. Die! I guess this is the end for me\\u2026 Naruto?! You surprised me there, freak. If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you! Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow! Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold! Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! You've\\u2026 Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu! What's this\\u2026? What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon! Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here! In that case\\u2026 I'll come to you. I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay? Yeah. He's really something. Maybe it is true. Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders\\u2026 Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something. Has anyone found Naruto yet? No. Darn, this is going to be bad\\u2026 There's no need to worry anymore. Lord Hokage! He'll be back soon. Sensei, how much longer? OK, you may open your eyes now. Congratulations\\u2026on your graduation. In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight! Iruka Sensei! That hurts! Naruto\\u2026 I was going to lecture to you... that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja. But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand\\u2026 W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me! You're smaller than me and you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage? I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not. It's not that easy to be a Hokage! If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!
